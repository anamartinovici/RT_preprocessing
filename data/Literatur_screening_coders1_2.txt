Experiment 1: In one block, the command (red or green light) was presented monocularly, in the other it was presented binocularly. The Ss saw either a red or a green light. Experiment 2: The Ss saw either a red or a green light in the center of their visual field. They pushed the correct response button as fast as they could, half of the Ss were told that a red light signaled a right response and a green light signaled a left response, while the other half were given the opposite color-response association, same color-response associations on both blocks	Nothing reported	1			HL		1			EB		1

 Picture test (measure of Simon effect): a color picture of either a frog or butterfly was presented on the left or right side of the computer screen, each stimulus had an associated right or left response, stimuli were presented randomly on the left or right of the screen over the block of 20 trials, yielding Congruent (compatible) and Incongruent (incompatible) trials
 Arrow test: a single large arrow was presented at the left or right of the computer screen, congruent:arrow pointed either straight down (toward the response button on the same sideas the arrow), incongruent: arrow pointed toward the opposite side at a 45° angle (toward the response button on the opposite side), Congruent and Incongruent trials were presented in a randomized Mixed block of 20 trials.
 Dot test: a large dot (diameter = 2.5 cm), was presented either at the left or right on each trial, two types of Dots (striped or solid) were used indicating left or right responses. An initial block of 20 Congruent trials (with all responses on the same side as the dot) was followed by a block of 20 Incongruent trials (with all responses on the side opposite the dot), and then by a Mixed block of 20 trials where Congruent and opposite trials were randomly intermixed"	"11 children were excluded from the analyses for failing to press any button or consistently pressing both

A trial started with the central fixation cross, lasting for a foreperiod (FP) of 1 or 3 s. The two values of the FP were presented randomly on an equal number of trials. After the FP elapsed, the arrow requiring a response was presented. The task consisted of pressing ‘Z’ for a short cross duration (i.e., 1 s) and ‘/’ for a long cross duration (i.e., 3 s). The stimulus duration/response key assignment was inverted after 160 trials. The order of presentation of the two possible S–R mappings was counterbalanced across participants. After a response was detected, a 1 s blank separated one trial from the other. A familiarization block, consisting of 20 trials, preceded each experimental block with opposite S–R mappings (160 trials each). During this phase, a visual feedback was displayed for 1 s soon after the response. The feedback provided during the initial practice phases consisted of the green string (in Italian): “good! Go on with the next trial!”, for correct responses, the red string: “wrong response, be careful!” plus a sound (a 1500 Hz pure tone lasting 50 ms) for incorrect responses, and the red string: “too slow, try to be faster!” (plus the 1500 Hz sound) for slow responses (>1500 ms) or null responses. The familiarization phase was repeated until participants made two errors or less. All participants reached this criterion after 1–2 familiarization phases. Experiment 2: A trial started with the presentation of the fixation cross, which marked the beginning of the FP (i.e., 1 vs. 3 s, 50% each, random presentation). When the FP ended, an arrow replaced the fixation. Participants were required to respond as fast as possible to the arrow by pressing the spacebar, with their right index finger in one block, and with their left index finger in the other block. The order of presentation of the 2 blocks was counterbalanced across participants. The arrow was removed by the response key-press. After a blank interval of 1 s, a new trial started. Two blocks of 80 trials (40 per each FP) were presented during each session to each participant. Ten practice trials preceded each experimental block. Experiment 3: Two blocks of 160 trials each were administered. In one block, the ‘Z’ key had to be pressed by the right hand after a short cross duration, and the ‘/’ key had to be pressed by the left hand after a long cross duration. The opposite S–R mapping was applied in the other block. The order of presentation of the 2 blocks was counterbalanced across participants. Half of each block was performed with the right hand standing on the top of the left one and the other half was performed with the left hand on the top of the right one. Half of the participants started each block with one position and then switched position after 80 trials. The opposite order was used for the other half of the participants. A practice phase with 20 trials (10 per each FP) was given at the beginning of each block. Similar feedback to that employed in Experiment 1 was displayed at the end of each trial during the practice phase. Experiment 4: The procedure and task were similar to those adopted in Experiment 1. The only difference was that the response should be given by pressing a key (‘B’) with the index finger of the dominant hand and another key (‘N’) with the middle finger of the same hand. The ‘B’ and ‘N’ keys were labeled and referred to in the instructions with a red and green color, respectively, in order to avoid linguistic biases. Indeed, a couple of pilot participants reported that it was difficult to associate the ‘B’ label to a long duration because ‘B’ is the initial letter of the word ‘brief’ (in Italian: ‘breve’). The red and green keys were inverted for half of the participants (i.e., ‘N’ = red; ‘B’ = green). In one block, participants had to press the key labeled with one color for a short cross duration, and the key labeled with another color for a long cross duration. In another block, the key-duration associations were inverted. The order in which the 2 key-duration mappings were administered was counterbalanced across participants. A familiarization phase (20 trials) with a feedback procedure similar to that used in Experiment 1 was adopted also here at the beginning of each block. After each familiarization phase, a test phase followed with 80 trials with a cross duration (i.e., FP) randomly varying between 1 and 3 s (50% each). Upon completion of the study, participants received a post-experimental questionnaire. In a first question, participants were asked if they had counted or used other strategies to perform the task. In a second multiple choice question, they were asked to choose a directionality for their representation of elapsing time. The available response choices were: left–right, right–left, top–down, bottom–up, clockwise, counterclockwise. The order with which these alternatives appeared varied randomly across participants. The option ‘other’ was also provided. Experiment 5: The procedure and task were basically similar to those used in Experiment 1, with the following exceptions. The six values of the FP (i.e., cross duration) were presented randomly on an equal number of trials (30 for each). The task consisted of pressing ‘Z’ for a short cross duration (i.e., 0.5, 1, and 1.5 s), and ‘/’ for a long cross duration (i.e., 2.5, 3, and 3.5 s). The stimulus duration/response key assignment was inverted after 180 trials. The order of presentation of the two possible S–R mappings was counterbalanced across participants. A familiarization block, consisting of 24 trials (4 per each cross duration), preceded each experimental block with opposite S–R mappings (180 trials each). During this practice block, similar feedback to that used in the previous experiments was provided at the end of each trial. The familiarization block was repeated until a criterion of three errors or less was reached. No more than three familiarization cycles were necessary for any participant. As for Experiment 4, after the completion of the test, participants were asked whether they had counted or used other strategies in order to perform the task."	no	1			JW		0	"no visual Simon task but

The gray outline of two squares was visible throughout each run, along with a fixation point. Each run was divided into several ‘‘miniblocks.’’ Each miniblock started with an instruction cue (a large uppercase ‘‘A’’ or a large uppercase ‘‘S’’; prior to the experiment, participants were instructed that when they saw an ‘‘A,’’ they were to focus on accuracy during the upcoming trials, and when they saw an ‘‘S,’’ they were to focus on speed during the upcoming trials). This cue lasted 1000 msec, followed by a 5000-msec fixation screen. After cue offset, the center-screen fixation point was changed to a small uppercase ‘‘A’’ or a small uppercase ‘‘S.’’ For each SAT condition (speed and accuracy emphasis), there were seven miniblocks of 4 trials, four miniblocks of 8 trials, and one miniblock of 20 trials within each run. Within each run, these miniblocks were presented in random order. Each run started and ended with a 12-sec fixation screen containing the two squares and the fixation point. During each Simon trial, one of the squares lit up either green or red for 150 msec, followed by a 2850-msec intertrial interval. The exception was the last stimulus of each miniblock, which was followed by a 14,850-msec fixation screen, after which the next cue was presented (thus, the stimulus onset asynchrony [SOA] from the last stimulus of a miniblock to the next cue was 15,000 msec). Prior to the experiment, participants were instructed to respond to the color of the square (red or green) with a left or right index finger button press (counterbalanced across participants). Congruent trials (2/3 of all trials) were trials during which the stimulus location and response hand corresponded (e.g., a left stimulus mapped onto the left hand); incongruent trials (1/3 of all trials) were trials during which the stimulus was mapped onto the opposite response hand (e.g., a left stimulus mapped onto the right hand)"	no	1			JW	not sure if this shall be included as it mainly focuses on fMRI, but it includes some behavioiral data as well	1			EB		1

A chin rest was used to maintain the subject’s eye at 1m from this screen. A yellow lightemitting diode (LED) fixed on the center of the screen served as a fixation point. The stimuli were delivered by two bicolor (red/ green) LEDs located on the left and right of the fixation point, the distance between the central LED and each lateral LED subtended 5.71 of visual angle. A video camera located directly below the central LED allowed the experimenter to control the fixation gaze. A loudspeaker located behind the screen delivered auditory feedback signals (see below). Two plastic cylinders (3 cm in diameter, 7.5 cm in height) were fixed 22 cm apart on the table and 11 cm on the left and right of the subject’s midsagittal plane and served as handgrips. The right handgrip was 9 cm closer to the screen than the left one, in order to allow a comfortable crossing of the arms. A force sensor (Interlinks Force Resistive Resistor, Interlinks Electronics, Inc., Camarillo, CA) was fixed on the top of each cylinder. The subject was to keep the distal phalanxes of his thumbs on the sensors. The response was an isometric press of 10 N on one of the two sensors according to the color of the stimulus, and was to be performed during the second following the stimulus. When one of the lateral LEDs was lit, the association was either congruent or incongruent, depending on whether the correct response was on the same side or on the opposite side as the signal. Design and Procedure A trial started with the illumination of the fixation point. One second later, a bicolor LED was lit either in red or in green for 50 ms. According to the color of this signal, the subject was instructed to press on either the left or the right force sensor, as quickly and accurately as possible. In the uncrossed arm condition, the left sensor was to be pressed with the left thumb and the right sensor with the right thumb, this assignment was reversed in the crossed arm condition. When a response was produced, an auditory feedback signal was delivered. It was a 3 ms, 1000 Hz sound (perceived as a weak click) if the response was correct, or a 200 ms, 400 Hz sound (perceived as a buzz) if the response was incorrect or too late (when the 10 N force criterion was not reached within 1 s after stimulus occurrence). The response extinguished the fixation point LED. The next trial started 4 s after the illumination of the preceding fixation point. The trials were presented in blocks of 64 in a pseudorandom order such that all stimuli were equifrequent. The experiment comprised one training session and two experimental sessions (14 blocks of trials each). Each session was performed on a different day; 48 hours at maximum separated two consecutive sessions. Following each block, the subject was given a few minutes of rest. During the training session, arm crossing was alternated every two blocks. During the experimental sessions, arm crossing was alternated after the first seven blocks. The assignment of the left and right force sensors to a color light, and the order according to which the arm crossing conditions were performed were balanced across subjects"	yes	1			JW	EMG recorded, but behavioural tasks recorded as well.	1		Yes	EB		1

Each S performed under two RT conditions: a choice (Donders' b) and a go-no go (Donders' c). Half of the Ss received the b RT condition first, and the others received the c RT condition first. Each S received eight practice trials before each condition. In the b RT condition there were two blocks of trials. The Ss responded on one block of trials with arms uncrossed, so that their left index finger was on the left key and their right index finger was on the right key. On the other block of trials Ss responded with their arms crossed, so that their left index finger was on the right key and their right index finger was on the left key. Each block consisted of the same random sequence of 76 trials.
 Either a low pitched (200-Hz.) or a high pitched (500-Hz.) tone was presented monaurally on each trial. Half of the Ss were told to respond with their
 right index finger when they heard the high-pitched tone and with their left index finger when they heard the low-pitched tone; the other half of the Ss were given the opposite hand—tone rule. Each S used the same hand-tone rule throughout the entire experiment. Within the b RT condition the crossed and uncrossed trial blocks were counterbalanced. In the crossed block, half of the Ss performed the
 task with the left arm over the right and the other half performed the task with the right arm over the left. In the c RT condition there were four blocks of
 trials. Each block consisted of the same random sequence of tones that was used in the b RT condition. On each block of trials S was instructed to respond when he heard one tone, not to respond when he heard the other tone, and to place only one index finger on one response key. Every S performed one block of trials with each of the possible combinations of index finger and key positions:
 right-on-right, right-on-left, left-on-left, and left-onright. The nonresponding arm was placed on the armrest alongside S out of the way of the responding hand. The order of presentation of the blocks of trials within the c RT condition was randomized.
Eight blocks of trials were presented. Six consisted of single-hand responses with each hand performing in turn on each response key. Two blocks of trials consisted of two-hand responding (crossed and uncrossed) in conjunction with another experiment. During two-hand responding trials, the S's task was to respond with both index fingers simultaneously while E recorded RT in milliseconds to the first key depressed. Half of the Ss received the two-hand block followed by the single-hand block, and the other half of the Ss received the trial blocks in the reverse order. The order of singlehand trial block presentation was randomized across all Ss. 
 The Ss were given 21 practice trials randomly presented so that there were 7 each in the right ear, the left ear, and binaurally. Practice responses were on a randomly chosen single-hand response key. Each trial block consisted of 63 randomly presented stimuli, 21 each to the right, left, and both ears. In between trial blocks, S was told that he had performed very well and then told which handresponse key condition would follow. The Ss were exhorted at the beginning of the experiment and
 between each trial block to respond as rapidly as possible. Further, they were told that the tone would appear sometimes in the right ear, sometimes in the left, and sometimes in both. Regardless of where the tone appeared, they were to respond as
 rapidly as possible with the assigned hand-key condition."	no	0	Donders paradigm (Arms crossed as condition) 	no	EP	Simon effect in Donders paradigm	0	auditory Simon task		LS_LW		0	Auditory Simon task

Upon return they were assigned to either the same version with the same assignment of response keys to color or a different version with different stimuli in different colors. For two versions the stimuli consisted of a red and a blue square. For the other two versions the stimuli consisted of a yellow and green circle. The stimuli were resized to 20% of the screen height. The experiment consisted of 8 practice trials and 92 critical trials. Participants were instructed to respond as accurately and quickly as possible to the color of the stimulus. They used the Z-key on their keyboard for one color and the /-key for the other color. Assignment of color to key was counterbalanced between participants. A trial started with a central fixation cross (+) in the center of the screen for 500 ms. Then the fixation cross was replaced with the stimulus. The stimulus was vertically centered and horizontally placed at 15% from the left or right side of the screen and remained visible until the participant pressed one of the response keys. If the response was incorrect, the message “Incorrect” was displayed for 500 ms. The inter trial interval was 1000 ms.

 All stimuli were presented in EGA text mode on a black screen.
 The uppercase letters X and Y served as target stimuli, to signal a
 left- and right-hand response respectively. They were presented in
 white but changed to red or green, depending on the response given, upon response onset. Targets appeared inside a one-pixel wide
 frame that could be either gray, red, or green. 
 Acquisition phase Each trial began with a blank interval of 1,500 ms, followed by the presentation of a gray frame. In the long SOA group the frame stayed for 1,000 ms before it was replaced by the target. In the short SOA group the frame accompanied the target and disappeared 150 ms after the onset of frame and target.
 Participants were verbally instructed to respond to the letter target by pressing the left or right key as quickly as possible within 1,000 ms while ignoring the frame. Each key press triggered a color
 change of the target (the action effect): Pressing the left key changed it to green and pressing the right key changed it to red. The color change took place on response onset and the colored target
 stayed for 500 ms. Participants worked through 80 valid acquisition trials comprising 40 miniblocks composed of a random sequence of the two targets or response-effect pairings.
 Test phase After having completed the acquisition trials, participants received a message on the screen informing them that from now on the frame would be colored, but that they were to ignore this color. Participants were prepared that this would happen as it had already been announced in the initial instruction. The actual
 task was exactly as in the acquisition phase; the only exception was that in a given trial the frame was either green or red. Participants worked through 280 valid test trials, comprising 70 miniblocks composed of a random sequence of the four possible combinations of two targets (or response-effect pairings) and frame colors.
combined the color-acquisition design of Experiment 1 with a manual 
Stroop task. Accordingly, participants were presented with congruently, 
neutrally, and incongruently colored words and they were to respond to 
word color by pressing a left or right key. Pressing a key produced or 
did not produce a color effect. Three groups were compared, one with a 
compatible mapping of color effect and target color, a second, control 
group without color effects, and a third group with an incompatible 
mapping.
The procedure was exactly as in Experiment 2, except that action effects were color words and that there was no control group."	yes	0	"Exp.1. Priming, Exp.2.

The participants were required to press the left or the right button as quickly and accurately as possible in response to the colour of the stimulus (circle or square) presented to the left or the right of the fixation point irrespective of its position. For half of the participants, the red stimulus was assigned to the left button and the green to the right button, and vice versa for the remaining half of the participants. The shape of the stimulus was either a circle or a square for each half of the participants. The experiment session consisted of 96 trials with each type defined by a factorial combination of stimulus colour (red or green) and stimulus position (left or right) being presented randomly. Each trial began with the appearance of the fixation cross at the centre of the monitor. After a waiting period that averaged 570 ms (ranging from 500–640 ms), the fixation disappeared, and the target appeared to the left or right of the centre until a response was made or 1,500 ms had elapsed, whichever came first. The intertrial interval (ITI) was 2,000 ms. When the participant made an incorrect response, a 500-ms blank interval was followed by presentation of a blue square (10.08  10.08) for 500 ms as feedback, and then the next trial began after a blank interval of 1,000 ms. There was no feedback for a correct response during the ITI. Go/no-go Simon task. The procedure was basically the same as the standard Simon task except that this task included no-go (withhold) trials, in which the stimulus was of a different shape from that of the standard Simon task. Thus, the session consisted of 96 go trials and 48 no-go trials that occurred quasi-randomly with a probability of 2 : 1. The number of sequences from a compatible trial to an incompatible trial and vice versa was matched within each type of preceding trial (go or no-go trials). The shape of the stimulus indicated the type of trial: A circle indicated a go trial for half of the participants and signalled a no-go trial for the remaining half. In go trials, the task was exactly the same as the standard Simon task. In no-go trials, the participants were instructed to withhold their response for 1,500 ms. When they made any response during this period, the trial terminated, and ITI began, in which a 500-ms blank interval was followed by presentation of a yellow square (10.08  10.08) for 500 ms as another form of feedback. Any error in go trials was followed by the same feedback as that in the standard Simon task	no	1	I think it should be included, although it compares younger and older participants		JW		1	go/no-go simon task		EB		1

Participants were tested in a dimly lit room, with their head on
a chin rest. The stimuli were presented on a NEC MultiSynch 4E
color monitor that was controlled by a Pentium microcomputer.
All experiments were programmed using C. Participants
viewed the display from a distance of 100 cm. The stimulus for the
first task (S1) was a computer-generated tone presented at 300 or
900 Hz, and lasting 150 ms. The stimulus for the second task (S2)
was visual and will be described in detail with each experiment.
The luminance of the second task stimuli was approximately 20
cd/m2 against a dark background (0.5 cd/m2
). In all experiments,
participants responded to the tone task with their left hand by
pressing one of two buttons mounted on a response board interfaced with the computer. The responses to the visual task were
either manual (using their right hand) or vocal and will be described separately for each experiment.
Design
The first of the two tasks in each trial was a tone discrimination
task in which participants had to decide if a tone was “high” or
“low.” S1 and S2 were separated by four different SOAs: 50, 150,
300, 900. Each of the four SOAs appeared in 25% of the trials.
Each of the tones appeared in 50% of the trials.
Each experiment consisted of two sessions. In Experiments 1 to
3, each session was divided into eight blocks of 96 trials each, and
in Experiments 4 to 6 each session was divided into eight blocks
of 80 trials. In all of the experiments, participants worked through
three practice blocks in the first session, prior to the eight blocks
of the experiment. First they performed a block of 30 practice trials
for the tone task only. Next they performed a short block of 16
trials for both tasks. Following the short demonstration block they
performed a practice block of 96 trials.
Procedure
Each trial began with the presentation of an achromatic asterisk,
serving as a fixation point. The fixation point appeared at the
center of the screen for 250 ms. After its offset, the tone was
presented at either 300 or 900 Hz for 150 ms. The visual stimulus
was presented after an interval of 50, 150, 300, or 900 ms. The
visual target remained on the screen until the participant responded
to both tasks. Participants were instructed to respond first to the
tone and then to the visual stimulus. The message “ERROR” was
presented on the screen for 500 ms following incorrect responses
with an added specification whether the error was on the first,
second or both of the tasks. In any case, the intertrial interval was
1,500 ms.
Participants were given verbal instructions explaining the course
of each trial. They were asked to respond rapidly and as accurately
as possible to both tasks. In addition, they were asked specifically
to respond rapidly to the tone, to discourage them from grouping
the two responses and respond to both as one unit (Pashler &
Johnston, 1989). Experiment 1: Stimuli and design. The stimuli for T2 were the words red,
green, and blue (in Hebrew) each consisting of four letters. Red
and green served as targets and all three words served as distracters. The letters were achromatic, each measuring approximately
0.52° of visual angle in height and 0.52° in width. The target
appeared at the center of the screen, flanked by two identical
distracters on each side. The center to center distance between the
target and distracters was approximately 2.71° of visual angle.
There were three congruency conditions: In the congruent condition the target and the distracters matched (e.g. red flanked by red).
In the incongruent condition the target was assigned to one response and the distracters were associated with the alternative
response (e.g. red flanked by green). In the neutral condition the
distracters (blue) were not associated with any response.
The PRP design resulted in a 4 (SOA)  2 (auditory targets for
T1)  2 (T2 targets)  3 (congruency)  48 different target
displays. In Experiment 1a participants responded to T2 manually
by pressing one of two response buttons mounted on a response
board connected to the computer. A voice key connected to the
computer, recorded response latencies in Experiment 1b. To allow
analysis of errors in Experiment 1b, the experimenter sat with
the participants throughout the experiment and coded their vocal
responses. Experiment 2: Stimuli and design. The targets for T2 in Experiment 2 were
the digits 3 and 4. The distracters were the digit words three, four,
and five. The words three and four in Hebrew consist of four
letters, and the word five consists of three letters. The letters and
digits were achromatic, each measuring approximately 0.52° of
visual angle in height and 0.52° in width. The center to center
distance between the target and distracters was approximately
1.90° of visual angle.
The combination of targets and distracters resulted in three
congruency conditions. In the congruent condition, the target and
distracters matched (e.g. the digit 3 surrounded by the word three).
In the incongruent condition, the target was assigned to one response and the distracters to the second response (e.g. the digit 3
surrounded by the word four). In the neutral condition the target
was assigned to one response and the distracters were not assigned
to any of the responses (e.g. the digit 3 surrounded by the word
five). The entire PRP design consisted of 48 different combinations
of tones and visual displays: 4 (SOA)  2 (auditory targets for
T1)  2 (T2 targets)  3 (congruency). Participants responded
manually to T2 by pressing one of two response buttons mounted
on a response board interfaced with the computer. Experiment 3: Stimuli and design. The target was a colored vertical line
(either red or green) subtending approximately 0.52° of visual
angle in length and 0.03° in width, which appeared at the center of
the screen. The distracters were the digits 3, 4, or 5. The digits
were achromatic, each measuring approximately 0.52° of visual
angle in height and 0.52° in width. The distracters appeared on the
two sides of the target and were always identical. The center-tocenter distance between the target and distracters was approximately 1° of visual angle. The combination of the targets and
flankers resulted in three congruency conditions as described
above. The overall PRP design resulted in a 4 (SOA)  2 (T1
targets)  2 (T2 targets)  3 (congruency)  48 different combinations of target displays. Participants responded vocally to the
second task, and the vocal response was registered by a voice key
interfaced with the computer. The experimenter sat with the participants throughout the experiment and scored their vocal response. Experiment 4: Stimuli and design. The prime words consisted of one of the
Hebrew words for red, green, yellow, or blue, each consisting of
four letters. Each letter measured approximately 0.52° of visual
angle in height and 0.52° in width. The target was a colored line
(red, green, yellow, or blue) subtending approximately 0.52° of
visual angle in length and 0.03° in width. All stimuli were presented at the center of the screen.
We used a 4 (stimuli) to 2 (manual responses) mapping. The
distracter-target combination led to three conditions (see Figure 3).
In the congruent condition, the distracter and target were the same
color. In the SR condition the distracter and target were different
colors, but both were associated with the same response. In the DR
condition, the color of the target differed from the distracter color
and was associated with the alternative response. The distracter
was congruent on 70% of the trials. Each of the other three colors
followed the cue in 10% of the trials, ensuring that the various
displays of these conditions appeared equally often. As a result, the
SR and DR conditions occurred in 10% and 20% of the trials,
respectively.
In this PRP design there were 32 different trials, 4 (SOA)  2
(auditory targets)  4 (second task targets) without consideration
of the prime. Because 70%, 10%, and 20% of each type of trial had
to be congruent, SR or DR, respectively, the design resulted in a
block of 32 (different trials)  10 (primes)  320 trials. Accordingly, each session consisted of two blocks of 320 trials in which
each possible combination appeared once. We divided each of the
two blocks to four subblocks of 80 trials each. The participants
received a short break after each of the eight subblocks.
The prime word for T2 appeared at the center of the screen for
100 ms, and was replaced by the target. The same four SOA
conditions were used in the present experiment as in previous
experiments. Because the prime preceded the target by 100 ms, the
SOAs between T1 and the T2 distracter were actually –50, 50, 200,
and 800 ms. We ran two versions of the experiment each with 13
participants, which differed only in the assignments of colors to
responses. In one version the colors red and green were assigned
for the first response, and blue and yellow for the second response.
In the second version, green and blue were assigned for the first
response and red and yellow for the second response. Experiment 5: Stimuli and design. The stimuli were identical to those of
Experiment 4. Participants named the color. This design led to two
conditions, the congruent condition in which the prime word
matched the target color, and the incongruent condition in which
the prime word and target color did not match. Each word was
followed equally often by each of the four target colors. As a result
25% of the trials were congruent and 75% of the trials were
incongruent. This design consisted of 4 (SOA)  2 (auditory
targets)  4 (second task targets)  4 (second task distracters),
creating 128 different trials. Each session consisted of five blocks
of 128 trials. The participants had a break every 64 trials.
The participants’ vocal responses were collected using a voicekey interfaced with the computer. The experimenter scored the
vocal responses throughout the experiment. Experiment 6: Stimuli and design. Like Experiments 4 and 5, the stimuli for
T2 consisted of a cue and a target. The cue was the Hebrew word
for digit (consisting of four letters) or for letter (consisting of three
letters). The targets were either digits (3, 7, 9) or letters (P, S, Z).
Each letter (cues and targets) and digit subtended approximately
0.52° of visual angle in height and 0.52° in width. We used a 6 (stimuli)  2 (response) mapping. Each letter or digit was preceded by a cue that indicated one of the two categories. On 80%
of the trials the cue indicated the category of the following target
(the congruent condition). On the remaining 20% of the trials the
cue indicated the other category (the incongruent condition). The
cue for T2 appeared at the center of the screen for 100 ms, and was
replaced by the target.
S1 and S2 were separated by the same four SOAs as in previous
experiments. Each of the four SOAs appeared in 25% of the trials.
There were 32 different trials, 4 (SOA)  2 (auditory targets)  2
(S2 category)  2 (congruency). The three targets for each category were chosen randomly on each trial. The 32 different trials
and 80% validity resulted in a minimal block of 160 trials. Each
session consisted of four blocks of 160 trials. As in Experiment 4
we divided each block to subblocks of 80 trials.
Participants responded vocally to the second task. The vocal
response was registered by a voice-activated device interfaced
with the computer. The category was the defining feature for the
response. Participants had to say two arbitrary words in response
to T2, the Hebrew word for white when the target was a digit, and
the Hebrew word for black when the target was a letter. The
experimenter sat with the participant throughout the experiment
and keyed their vocal responses."	no	1			JW		0			HL		0	No Simon task

The subjects were seated in front of an IBM 386 computer connected to an NEC MultiSync 3FG color monitor through a VGA card. The experiment was run using the Micro Experimental Laboratory (MEL, Version 2.0) software system. A central 0.7º  0.7º cross was presented at fixation, accompanied by a 440-Hz warning tone. Target stimuli were two colored squares (green and red) approximately 1.5º  1.5º in size, shown 10º to the right and to the left of fixation. Responses were executed by pressing the F key (left of body midline) or the K key (right of body midline) with the left or right index finger, respectively. Both keys were covered by white stickers. Procedure. All the subjects performed a Simon task. Trials began with the presentation of the fixation cross, which remained visible for 1,800 msec. The acoustic warning tone was delivered at the onset of fixation and lasted for 300 msec. At the offset of fixation, the imperative stimulus appeared for 100 msec. After 1,700 msec, a new trial began. The maximum allowed response time was 1,500 msec. There was a total of 144 experimental trials, equally distributed across the four stimulus position  response position conditions and presented in random order. The experimental trials were preceded by as many practice trials as were needed to execute 10 correct trials. Half of the subjects were instructed to press the right key in response to the red square and the left key in response to the green square.

The participants were seated 100 cm away from the screen. Only one animal was presented at a time, in the top or the bottom half of the screen. Stimuli were orange animals “from the land” (lion, leopard, tiger and puma) and blue animals “from the sea” (dolphin, whale, orca, fish). Half of the participants were asked to feed the orange animals and the other half were asked to feed the blue animals by pressing on a button when they saw a ‘Go’ animal (i.e. the one they had to feed) and to withhold their response for a ‘Nogo’ animal. 80% of the trials were Go, 20% were Nogo. A cue (small asterisk) preceded the presentation of the animal and was presented for 150 ms in the top or the bottom half of the screen. This cue predicted the location of the animal 65% of the time, although no such information was given to the participants. The trial was called congruent if the cue and the animal appeared at the same location; and incongruent if the cue and the animal appeared in different halves of the screen (see Fig 1). The cue and the targets were presented at a visual angle of 1° and 2° respectively. The inter-trial interval was 1000 ms. The animals were equally and randomly presented in the top or the bottom half of the screen. Participants gave behavioral responses by pressing a button on a game pad with the left or right thumb. For half of the participants, the top button was on the left side, for the other half it was on the right side. The cue and the stimulus were presented to the top or to the bottom of the screen to ensure that both visual fields (left and right) were equally stimulated, thus avoiding any confounding brain activity in the LRP analyses. Each trial consisted of a fixation sign (drawing of an eye) shown for 500 ms followed by a 1000 ms blank period. Then, the cue was presented for 150 ms, and the stimulus was presented after a 500 ms blank-screen and for a maximum of 1750 ms. The stimulus disappeared when the participant gave a response (or stayed on the screen for the maximum period for Nogo trials). The offset of the stimulus was followed by a 1000 ms blank screen. Participants were advised to blink only when they saw the drawing of an eye. The experiment took on average 1.5 h to complete. The children completed five blocks of 90 stimuli (altogether 248 Go Congruent trials, 112 Go Incongruent trials, 45 NoGo Congruent trials and 45 Nogo Incongruent trials) and the adults completed 10 blocks. The experiment was preceded by 20 practice trials. Stimuli were presented by the Presentation program of the Neurobehavioral Systems (San Fransisco, CA, USA). Data were recorded in an acoustically and electrically shielded testing booth. EEG was recorded by an Electrical Geodesics system with a 64-channel Geodesic Sensor Net for children and a 128-channel Geodesic Sensor Net for adults. The sampling rate was 500 Hz. An on-line lowpass filter of 70 Hz was used. The data were band-pass filtered between 0.03 and 30 Hz off-line and were recomputed to average reference. Epochs extended from ?850 to +850 ms relative to stimulus presentation. Data were baseline corrected by a baseline of ?200 to 0 ms relative to stimulus presentation (for N2 analyses), or ?200 to 0 relative to the cue presentation (for LRP analyses). Epochs containing ocular artefacts (monitored at electrodes below, above, and next to the eyes) and epochs containing voltage deviations exceeding ±200 ?V relative to baseline at any of the recording electrodes were rejected. The maximal allowed voltage step was 50 ?V/ms. Participants with less than 60% of all trials accepted after artefact rejection were excluded from the sample (two children and one adult). On average, 76% of trials were kept in children and 89% in adults.
 
 Averaged ERPs were computed for each participant in the four different conditions: (1) Go Congruent trials (GC); (2) Go Incongruent trials (GI); (3) NoGo Congruent trials (NGC); and (4) NoGo Incongruent trials (NGI). Only correct response (Go) or correct no response trials (Nogo) were included in the averaging procedure. After artefact rejection and selection of correct trials, an average of 287 trials were kept per child participant (172 GC, 79 GI, 32 NGC and 4 NGI) and 747 per adult participant (436 GC, 193 GI, 78 NGC and 40 NGI)."	yes- some data rejected because of EEG artefacts	0	children (and adults) tested, EEG analyses done		JW		0	vertical simon task		DFD_KM		0	Vertical task

 were executed by pressing one of two keys on the computer keyboard.
 These keys were on the left and right of the body midline (the D and L
 character, respectively) and were operated with the corresponding index
 finger.
 Stimuli. A central 0.8°  0.8° white (77 cd/m2
 ) cross served as the
 fixation mark. It was accompanied by a 1000-Hz warning tone at 70 db.
 This tone emanated from two loudspeakers that were contiguous to the two
 sides of the monitor screen (one on the left and one on the right). Target
 stimuli were two colored squares 1.9°  1.9° in size, shown at the center
 of the screen. They were green (55 cd/m2
 ) and red (20 cd/m2
 ). Both the
 fixation cross and the target stimuli were presented on the same background region 29.9°  22.6° in size, within whose boundaries 5,376 white
 dots were displayed on a black (3 cd/m2
 ) ground. The dots were 0.04° 
 0.04° in size and had a uniform distribution, the number of dots in each
 0.95°  0.95° subsection being equal (seven dots). The cue region was
 defined by a 1.9°  1.9° area within the background of target stimuli. This
 region could be in one of two positions on the horizontal plane (the center
 of this region being 5.7° to the left or right of fixation) and in one of three
 different positions on the vertical plane (the center of the region being 1.9°
 above, 1.9° below, or aligned with fixation). These three vertical positions
 are referred to as top, bottom, and middle positions, respectively. Within
 the cue region, 80 dots in a random position were added to the background
 (see Figure 1).
 Procedure. Trials began with presentation of the fixation cross on the
 dot background. The fixation remained visible for 1,500 ms. The acoustic
 warning tone was delivered at the onset of fixation and lasted 300 ms. At
 the offset of fixation, the imperative stimulus appeared, together with the
 80 additional dots in the cue region. This visual pattern remained on the
 screen until a response was made but not longer than 1,500 ms. The offset
 of the stimulus was followed by a blank interval of 300 ms. Responses with
 the wrong key and with latencies in excess of 1,500 ms were counted as
 errors. In both cases, auditory error feedback was given during the blank.
 Half of the participants were instructed to press the right key in response
 to the red square and the left key in response to the green square. The
 opposite mapping was assigned to the other participants. They were told to
 respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. There were 144 randomly
 mixed trials, equally distributed across the 12 conditions (2 horizontal cue
 positions  3 vertical cue positions  2 target colors, 12 trials for each
 condition). Experimental trials were preceded by four practice trials. Experiment 1B: The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were the same as those in Experiment 1A, with the exception of the
 target and cue-region positions. The same target– cue patterns as in Experiment 1A were presented so as to align the middle of the imaginary line that
 joined the centers of the target and the cue region with fixation. The center
 of the target and the center of the cue region could be 0.95° above, 0.95°
 below, or aligned with fixation and 2.85° to the left or right of fixation. The
 positions of the cue region and target were symmetric (e.g., left–top targets
 were accompanied by right– bottom cues; see Figure 2). Experiment 2A; Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure. The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure for the Simon task were the same as those used in Experiment 1A. The
 only difference was that one dot (as opposed to 80) was added in the cue
 region of the background.
 After the Simon task, detection trials were administered, in which aware
 (80-dot addition), unaware (one-dot addition), and no-dot conditions were
 intermixed. There were 39 stimuli for each target color condition (red and
 green): three stimuli without dot addition and three stimuli for each
 condition resulting from the combination of cue dot number (one and 80),
 horizontal cue position, and vertical cue position. The procedure was the
 same as in the Simon task, but immediately after each trial, the participant
 was prompted by the computer to say whether she had noticed a dot
 addition to the background (i.e., the cue) simultaneously with the target
 onset. The participant’s answer was recorded by the experimenter. The
 participant was then prompted to report whether the cue had occurred at the
 left or right side of the target. All participants were encouraged to respond
 in all trials, irrespective of whether they were subjectively aware of a dot
 addition. As soon as the answer was entered by the experimenter, a new
 trial began. The participants were instructed that the posttarget cue reports
 were nonspeeded and that they were to make their decisions as accurately
 as they could. Experiment 2B: Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure. The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were the same as those used in Experiment 2A, except that the
 monitor contrast was adjusted to slightly reduce the luminance of the white
 dots (both background and cue dots; 66 cd/m2
 ). By turning down the
 monitor contrast, the luminance of the green and red target squares also
 diminished (47 cd/m2 and 17 cd/m2
 , respectively), thus the cue–target
 luminance ratio remained constant. Experiment 2C: Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure. The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were the same as in Experiment 2B, with the exception of the cue-region position on the horizontal plane: The center of this region could
 be 1.9° above, 1.9° below, or aligned with fixation (as in the previous
 experiments) and 9.5° to the left or right of fixation (i.e., an increase of
 about 4° in eccentricity compared with the previous experiments). Experiment 3A: Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure. The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were as in Experiment 1A, with the following exception. After an
 interval of 250 ms, 200 ms, 150 ms, or 100 ms from the target– cue onset,
 the target began to flash, that is, it went out for 50 ms and then went on for
 50 ms and so on, until a response was made. Participants were randomly
 assigned to one of the four onset–flashing interval conditions (12 participants for each condition). Experiment 3B: Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure. The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were as in Experiment 3A except that the cue was the addition of only one
 dot to the background and the Simon task was followed by a cue-detection
 task. This task was identical to those used in Experiments 2A, 2B, and 2C
 except for the target flashing, which occurred after the same interval as in the
 Simon task. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four target
 onset–flashing interval conditions (14 participants for each condition)"	not reported	0	Seems to be too different from the actual Simon task		ME		0	"accessory Simon effect elicited

W.	10.1037/0096-3445.134.1.93	Experiment 1: The experiments were conducted in two identically configured appara-tuses, with half of the birds in each experiment run in one apparatus andhalf in the other. Each apparatus consisted of a BRS/LVE (Laurel, MD)three-key intelligence panel (Model PIP-016) mounted inside a small-animal chamber (Model SEC-002) that was located in a dark, sound-attenuating room. The pigeons’ compartment in each chamber measured 37cm high30 cm wide34 cm deep. The three circular response keys onthe intelligence panel were 2.5 cm in diameter and were spaced 8.3 cmapart, center to center. The horizontally aligned keys were approximately25 cm above the grid floor on which the bird stood. Mounted behind eachkey was a 12-stimulus inline projector (Model IC-901-IDD) equipped toproject a small, inverted white triangle onto the center response key(BRS/LVE Pattern No. 692) and red, green, and white homogenous fieldsonto each of the two side keys (BRS/LVE Pattern No. 692). A shieldedhouse light (General Electric 1829 bulb) located 5.7 cm above the centerkey provided general chamber illumination. Its metal cover directed lighttoward the ceiling. Food reinforcement (Purina Pigeon ProGrains) wasdelivered via a rear-mounted feeder that birds could access through a5.8-cm wide5.0-cm high opening centered approximately 13 cm belowthe center response key. When raised, the feeder was lit by a 28-ESBminiature bulb located near the top of the back wall of its metal housing.A blower fan on the outside of each chamber provided continuous venti-lation and masking noise. IBM-compatible 386 computers located in aseparate room controlled the presentation, scheduling, and recording of all experimental vents. Expeirment 2: Eight White Carneaux (Columba livia) retired breeders, obtained fromthe same supplier and housed and maintained in the same fashion as thepigeons in Experiments 1A and 1B, served in this experiment. All 8 hadperformed in two-choice delayed matching tasks. Five were familiar withthe stimuli used here, although their prior behavioral contingencies withthese stimuli were quite different. Moreover, all birds went through thesame preliminary training sequence (described in theProceduresection) toequate their immediate pre-Simon-task experiences.All 8 birds were run in a single apparatus like those used in Experiments1A and 1B, except that the projector behind each side key was nowequipped to present three white vertical lines and three white horizontallines on black backgrounds (BRS/LVE Pattern No. 692). Experiment 3: The experiment was run in two chambers identical to those used previ-ously, with half of the birds in each group run in each chamber. Thestimulus projectors behind the side keys were equipped to project red,yellow, white, and blue homogeneous fields on the left and right keys(BRS/LVE Pattern No. 692). Experiment 4: One of the three-key panels used in Experiment 3 was used for thisexperiment. The panel was completely cleaned and partially extendedoutside of its enclosing chamber so that a human, seated comfortably in achair facing the panel, could easily see and touch each of the three responsekeys. The food magazine solenoid was disconnected during their partici-pation, but the light inside of the housing that covered the magazineremained operative to provide immediate feedback for correct side-keyresponses. The stimuli appearing on the center and on the side keys wereidentical to those used in Experiment 3. The room in which the participantperformed the task was the same room in which the pigeons were run, butno other pigeon experiments were in progress at the time. The lights in theroom were off, but the door was left open to provide a sufficient amountof illumination from the adjoining control room. Experiment 5: Four experimentally naive pigeons obtained from the same supplier andhoused in the same fashion as previously described initially participated inthe partial reinforcement manipulation. Only 2 achieved high levels ofaccuracy, even with a correction procedure, so an additional 4 experiencedpigeons were run under the same conditions. Only 2 of these reached bothhigh and stable levels of accuracy. Thus, a total of 4 birds, 2 naive and 2experienced, contributed to the latency data reported here. The priormatching-to-sample experiences for the latter birds were orthogonal to theSimon task contingencies.The apparatuses were identical to those described previously, with redand yellow serving as the relevant color cues and white and blue as thealternative stimuli.	Experiment 1: With the exception of the 1 bird in Experiment 1A that wasdropped for nonperformance reasons, the remaining 7 birds acrossExperiments 1A and 1B eventually reached high and relativelystable levels of accuracy, although for some this required theaddition of a correction procedure. The total number of trainingsessions needed to reach a consistent 90% level of performanceranged from 3 to 23 for these 7 subjects. Experiment 2: The 7 pigeons that reached criterion (i.e., three consecutivesessions with 90% or better accuracy on both red and green trials)on the initial task took between 3 and 26 sessions to achieve thatlevel of performance. For the birds not requiring a correctionprocedure, the range was 3–6 sessions, whereas for the 2 birds forwhich a correction procedure was necessary, it was 22 and 26sessions, respectively.	0	Focuses on Birds		ME	screened by JW.

Revisiting the affective Simon effect	2008	Duscherer, K., Holender, D., & Molenaar, E.	https://doi.org/10.1080/02699930701339228	"Participants were told that nouns and adjectives would be presented on the screen and that they had to classify these words according to their grammatical category. They were asked to respond fast and accurately. For the 20 participants in the neutral instruction condition, there was no information whatsoever about the affective connotation and the meaning of the words. In contrast, the 20 participants in the directed instruction condition were explicitly told that each word had a strong affective connotation and that they should try to ignore the affective value of the words while doing the classification task. Half the participants were instructed to say the word positive when they saw a noun, and the word negative when they saw an adjective, and vice versa for the other half. On each trial, a single word was presented at the centre of the screen until the voice key recorded a response or for a maximum of 2000 ms. Then, the stimulus vanished and was followed by a black screen for 2000 ms. Errors, ambiguous responses, or extraneous vocal activity were recorded online for later editing of the data set. Words were presented in light-grey on a black background, using the lowercase standard font of the computer. At a viewing distance of 60 cm, the visual angles subtended by each letter were 0.52 degrees in height and 0.31 degrees in width, the gap between two letters being 0.1 degree. The 120 experimental words were presented a first time in a fixed (i.e., the same for each participant) pseudorandomised sequence constructed with the constraints that there were never more than three consecutive words of the same affective connotation or of the same grammatical category. This was followed by a second presentation of the same 120 words with a different randomisation. A short pause was introduced after completion of 60 trials in each sequence. Each participant was tested individually in one session of about 40 minutes consisting of one practice block of 30 trials and 4 blocks of 60 experimental trials, each beginning with 2 warm-up trials. After the experiment, through a questionnaire we assessed whether participants were aware of the aim of the experiment and to what degree they paid attention to the affective connotations of the words. In Experiment 2a, participants received instructions that contained no information about the affective connotation of the presented words. They were told that the experiment was part of a research project about grammatical processing. Every word was presented just once, in a fixed pseudorandomised sequence constructed with the constraints that there were never more than three consecutive words of the same affective connotation or the same grammatical category. There was a break after each 40 trials. Each participant was tested individually in one session of about 40 minutes consisting of one practice block of 30 trials, and four blocks of 40 experimental trials (each preceded by one warm-up trial). One trial consisted of the following sequence of events: (a) a fixation cross for 500 ms at the centre of the screen; (b) a black screen for 500 ms; (c) a single word presented at the centre of the screen until the voice key recorded a response or for a maximum of 3000 ms; and (d) a black screen. After each trial, the experimenter encoded the response (positive, negative, no response, or voice-key error); the next trial was initiated 1500 ms after the code was entered.
 
 In Experiment 2b, participants were told to ignore the affective connotation of the presented words. The 40 experimental words were presented twice with a single break between the two presentation blocks, and no warm-up trials were used."	yes	0	Uses affective Simon task		ME		0	affective Simon task		HL		0	Affective Simon task

 room. Each subject was seated in front of an opaque, black display panel
 at a distance of 57 cm. The panel consisted of seven light-emitting diodes
 (LEDs, diameter 0.5"" of visual angle) arranged in three vertically aligned
 columns, and three metal touch pads protruding 3 cm from the face of the
 panel. The middle column of LEDs consisted of a yellow (at the top), a
 red and a green LED. The side columns had only two LEDs, one red and
 one green. In the vertical direction the LEDs were positioned next to each
 other, and in the horizontal direction they were spaced 10"" of visual angle apart. The touch pads formed a horizontal row 28cm below the LED
 lights. The middle touch pad (a hold pad) and the middle column of LEDs
 were aligned on the same vertically oriented axis. The lateral touch pads
 (response pads) were 7.5cm to the left and right of the middle pad
 (see Fig. 1).
 A trial commenced with the presentation of the yellow LED (warning
 signal). The subjects were asked to fixate the yellow LED and hold the
 central pad until one of the green or red LEDs (reaction signal) was
 illuminated. Eye movements were monitored through a suitably oriented
 mirror. This simpe method for controlling eye movements has been used
 in other experiments (e.g. Rizzolatti, Riggio, Dascola, & Umilta, 1987;
 Umilta, Riggio, Dascola, & Rizzolatti, 1991). The subjects were instructed
 to use their right hand for responding and base their responses on the
 colour of the reaction signal, irrespective of its location. They were
 required to release the central pad and touch the left pad for green LEDs
 and the right pad for red LEDs. The subjects were told that their speed
 of response would be measured. They were instructed to respond as
 quickly as possible, avoiding incorrect responses if at all possible. The
 period during which the yellow warning signal was on varied at random
 between 0.5, 1,2, 4, 8 and 16 sec. Immediately after the yellow LED went
 off, a red or green LED came on for 500 msec. The colour and location
 of the LED varied randomly within the single block of testing. The experimental trials were divided into three conditions. The number
 of trials in each condition was the same (60 trials). The experimental
 conditions were defined as follows:
 1. Neutral condirion. A green or red LED was presented in the central
 position. In this condition, the location of the LED was not associated with
 the lateral direction of the impending response signalled by the colour of
 the LED.
 2. Compatible condition. A green LED was presented on the left-hand
 side and a red LED on the right-hand side relative to the centrally located
 fixation point. Thus, in this condition, there was a congruence between
 the location of the reaction signal and the direction of the manual
 response.
 3. Incompatible condition. A red LED was presented on the left-hand
 side and a green LED on the right-hand side relative to the fixation point.
 In this condition, an incongruence existed between the location of the
 reaction signal and the direction of the response.
 A touch to the response pad was detected and a sound signal indicated
 a correct response. The next trial began immediately after a response,
 whether correct or incorrect. If a response had not been made within
 a 3 sec time window, the next trial was started automatically. Before
 data collection, each subject was given 48 practice trials. The testing
 session consisted of 180 trials. The display panel and data collection were
 controlled by a Commodore-64 microcomputer."	yes	1			ME		1	"RT from Simon task, but

Subjects viewed the monitor through a mirror stereoscope (Geoscope Ltd, see Fig. 1). Two outline squares (8×8 dgv, .1 cd/m2) were continuously presented to promote fusion. The target stimuli were red and blue gaussian patches (radius=2 dgv, .4 cd/m2) presented in the center of the fusion squares. The background was black (.004 cd/m2). We used gaussians to minimize possible geometrical distortions produced by the monitor and mirrors that might serve as cues for the eye-of-origin. The stimuli were presented in two pulses of 14 ms each (one refresh rate of the monitor), separated by 100 ms. The reason for this pulsed presentation was to increase the chances of generating an eye-specific given that transient stimulation enhances utrocular discrimination (Martens et al., 1981). The subjects reacted by pressing one of two keys with their right index or middle finger. The experiment comprised a Simon task and an utrocular discrimination task that were identical except for the instructions. In the Simon task, subjects reacted to the color and the assignment of colors to left and right keys was counterbalanced across subjects. In the utrocular discrimination task, subjects reacted to the stimulated eye by pressing the left key for the left eye and the right key for the right eye. There was no feedback in either of the tasks. Each task consisted in six blocks of 20 trials each, with 30-s rests in between blocks. The intertrial interval varied randomly between 2,000 and 3,500 ms. All subjects performed the Simon task first.	yes	1			ME		1			LD_HP		1

M.	10.1037/xhp0000379	"For the participant as well as for the confederate, who was oriented in a 90° angle to the participant, viewing distance was approximately 70 cm. Throughout the entire study, the same young man acted as the confederate. Each trial started with the presentation of a fixation cross (subtending 0.66° of visual angle, presented in the center of the screen) for 350 ms. Subsequently, the screen turned blank for 100 ms after which, randomly, one of the two stimuli (top black disk vs. bottom black disk) was shown for 1200 ms. Participants performed two conditions (blindfolded and seeing) with two blocks (compatible and incompatible) each. Each block contained 100 trials and participants were asked to respond as fast and accurately as possible. To establish different compatibility relations, we varied the sitting position of the confederate and the stimulus–response mapping of the participants. In one half of the experiment, participants were instructed to respond to the appearance of the top black disk by pressing the right button on the button box with their right index finger and to respond to the bottom black disk by pressing the left button with
 their left index finger, respectively. In the other half, the mapping was reversed and they were thus instructed to respond to the appearance of the top black disk with a left and to the appearance of the bottom black disk with a right button press. In the compatible condition, the mapping of the participant concurred with the spatial orientation of the confederate, but in the incompatible condition, it did not. For instance, if the confederate sat 90° to the left of the participant, participants were instructed with the “upleft, down-right” mapping in the compatible, and with the “upright, down-left” mapping in the incompatible block (see Figure 1A). The task of the confederate changed throughout the experiment, which was crucial. During the seeing condition, the confederate was asked to flap the shutters of his goggles up and respond to the visual stimuli on the screen. Specifically, the confederate was instructed to respond with a left button press if a black disk appeared—from his point of view— on the left side of the screen, and with a right button press if a black disk appeared on the right side of the screen. In the other half of the trials (i.e., during the
 blindfolded condition), the confederate was given a pair of headphones and was asked to flap the shutters of his goggles down to respond to auditory stimuli. He was instructed to respond to a high tone with a “right” and to a low tone with a “left” button press on the button box. The high and low tones appeared at the same time as the visual stimuli, but could only be heard through the headphones. To ensure that the confederate performed the same actions in the two conditions, the high tone always appeared together with the up stimulus, whereas the low tone appeared together with the down stimulus. Before the blindfolded condition started, a short practice block was conducted, during which the participant and the confederate switched tasks. This practice block was conducted to familiarize participants with the task involving the goggles. Hence, for the duration of the practice block, the experimenter asked the participants to sit where the confederate would sit later on (and vice versa). The instructions that were given (both for the auditory and for the visual task) during this practice block were identical to the instructions given during the experimental condition. After 10 practice trials, the practice block was over and both the participant and the confederate were instructed to swap places, so that for the experimental trials, the participant always performed the visual SRC task while the confederate consecutively performed the auditory task in addition to the visual SRC task. It is important to note, participants could not hear the tones to which the confederate responded when he was performing the auditory task. Before each block, 10 practice trials familiarized the participants with the task. These were later excluded from the statistical analysis. The order of conditions (blindfolded vs. seeing), the position of the confederate (90° to the left vs. to the right of the participant), as well as the order of mappings (compatible vs. incompatible) was counterbalanced across participants."	yes	0	Joint Simon task		ME		0	no classical Simon task		HL		0	Joint Simon task

Consequently, there were 2 different incongruent stimuli (when the patch appeared on the side opposite to the required key-press) and 2 different congruent stimuli (when the patch appeared on the side corresponding to the required key-press). Each one of the 4 stimuli conditions appeared 20 times in the experimental blocks (i.e., 80 stimuli in each experimental block). A practice block consisting of 16 trials preceded experimental blocks. Procedure Data collection and stimulus presentation were controlled by a Compaq computer with an Intel Pentium III central processor. Stimuli were presented on a Compaq S510 monitor. A keyboard was placed on a table between the participant and the monitor. Coloured stickers were placed on the keyboard keys according to the colours they represented, in a balanced layout. For half of the participants the “D” key represented red, and the “L” key represented blue, and for the other half of the participants the “D” key represented blue, and the “L” key represented red. The participants pressed the “D” key with their left index finger and the “L” key with their right index finger.
 At the beginning of the experiment, participants performed the Ishihara Colour Blindness Test to insure the correctness of their colour vision. They were then instructed to perform a Simon task. Participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible without making mistakes. They sat approximately 60 cm from the computer screen. Participants practised on 16 Simon trials. Each trial started with the appearance of a blank white screen for 500 ms, followed by a 500-ms fixation point—a black plus sign at the centre of the white screen. After the fixation point disappeared, the stimulus appeared at either the right or the left of the central vertical meridian of the screen and remained in view until the participant responded or 3,500 ms elapsed. For incorrect trials, a 1,000-ms feedback message with the word “error” appeared before the next trial began. RT in milliseconds was measured by the computer from stimulus onset until the participant's response. After performing the practice trials, participants performed two experimental blocks of the Simon task with trials identical to those of the practice block. EXPERIMENT 2: Stimuli Congruent and incongruent stimuli were identical to those used in Experiment 1. There were two types of neutral conditions that were presented in two different blocks. Since there were two congruent condition trials and two incongruent condition trials, four neutral condition trials were presented in each block. In one block the central neutral was presented four times (twice in red and twice in blue). In the second block the vertical neutral was presented once for each combination of colours (red on top, blue on top, red at the bottom, and blue at the bottom). Overall there were 80 trials in each experimental block (2 incongruent, 2 congruent and 4 neutral, each presented 10 times). Two 16-trial practice blocks were performed, each one consisting of the relevant type of neutral for the subsequent experimental block. Procedure The procedure of Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment 1 except for the Simon task sequence. Before each experiment block participants performed a practice block, which consisted of the relevant type of neutral for the upcoming block. The conditions were balanced, both for colour–key pressing and for block order (a quarter of the participants performed the central neutral type trials first where red patches were responded to by a right-hand finger press, a quarter performed the central neutral type trials first where blue patches were responded to by a right-hand finger press, etc.)."	not reported	1			ME		1			LS_LW		1

Stimuli included a blue “X” or red “X” (1? high, ½? wide), displayed on the left or right of the screen (positioned 5½? from the top and bottom of the screen, and 2? from the left or right side of the screen, respectively). Stimulus presentation and data collection were controlled using Direct RT. An Apple keyboard, modified to be millisecond accurate, was used to collect reaction time data. The shift keys were used as response indicators on the keyboard. A red sticker was placed on the right shift key and a blue sticker was placed on the left shift key. The monitor and the keyboard were placed in the center of a desk, with the keyboard 7? from the front of the desk and 8? from the monitor. Participants were seated in chairs that were placed next to each other in front of the keyboard. Each seated participant was positioned approximately 30? from the display screen.
 
 Procedure
 Participants completed a visual go/no-go Simon task in which they were instructed to respond with a key press to a specific color of a stimulus presented on the screen. Participants were assigned only one of the two stimulus colors (e.g., red) and were instructed to respond only to their designated color, regardless of location, while ignoring the alternative color (e.g., blue). Participants completed the task in one of two experimental conditions: a joint condition or an individual condition. For the individual condition, participants performed the task alone. For the joint condition, pairs of participants performed the task together. Similar to the procedure of [6], subjects assigned to the red key sat on the right, and subjects assigned the blue key sat on the left, regardless of condition (see Figure 1). A brief instruction screen was presented on the computer monitor prior to the start of the experiment. Clarifying instructions were administered verbally and an opportunity for questions or clarification was offered. Each trial began with a white crosshair presented for 400 ms in the center of the screen, followed by a blank screen also lasting 400 ms. Stimuli were presented for a maximum time of 1200 ms or until a response was indicated. Irrespective of RT, 400 ms of a blank screen was then presented 1200 ms after the stimulus presentation, followed by the white crosshair indicating the beginning of the next trial. In all conditions, participants completed 1100 trials, preceded by eight practice trials. An equal number of red and blue stimuli on both the left and right sides of the display were presented in a random order over the duration of the experiment."	no	0	This focuses on the social Simon effect		ME	social Simon effect	0			LS_LW		0	Joint Simon task

Two green/red light-emitting diodes (LEDs), separated by 10 cm, were positioned at both sides of a black panel placed 1.6 m in front of the participant. Two force sensors, separated by 8 cm, were fixed on the right and the left sides of the footrest. Participants were asked to exert a press with the big toe, as quickly and accurately as possible, on the right or on the left force sensor as soon as one of a LEDs lit up. The light could be green or red and could be delivered either to the left or to the right side. Participants were asked to respond according to the color of the LED (task-relevant attribute), and to ignore the location of the LED (the task-irrelevant attribute). Six participants had to exert a press with the left big toe when the LED was red and a press with the right big toe when the LED was green, the six other participants were to perform the reverse stimulus-response mapping. Each block was self-initiated by a press exerted on one of the two sensors. At the end of each trial, an auditory signal was delivered (1600 Hz, 75 dB, 200 ms) to inform the participant of the recording of the response. The delivery of a response turned off the stimulus and the next trial began. The intertrial interval was 1 s. There were two types of trials in each block: congruent trials (50%) and incongruent trials (50%). In congruent trials (CO), the lateral locations of the
 stimulus and response corresponded (e.g., left stimulus/left response). In contrast, in incongruent trials (IN), the lateral locations of the stimulus and response counter-corresponded (e.g., left stimulus/right response). For a video illustration, see http://karen.davranche.free.fr/Videoprotocol.avi Participants took part in two separate sessions run on different days: a pretest session and an experimental session. The resistance of the rotating fan, chosen to allow an uncontrived paddling movement at a reasonable stroke rate, was maintained constant throughout the experiment (male: 6/10 and female: 4/10). During the pretest session, participants undertook a habituation session on the Simon conflict task, consisting of two blocks of 64 trials each performed at rest and while paddling. This was followed by a continuous incremental protocol until exhaustion on a kayak ergometer to determine the exercise workload of the experimental session. The maximal test began by a 5-min warm-up at 50 W, and then the workload progressively increased until exhaustion (male: 20 W/min and female: 15 W/ min). The baseline heart rate (HRrest) and HRmax recorded during the pretest session are reported in Table 1. During the experimental session, participants were required to perform the cognitive task simultaneously with paddling. A first set of five blocks of 64 trials each was performed while paddling at a very light intensity fixed at 10% (± 2.5%) above HRrest and a second set of 5 blocks of 64 trials each was performed at a moderate intensity. The moderate exercise intensity was obtained using the Karvonen formula (Brooks, Fahey, & White, 1996) for calculating a target heart rate (THR) corresponding to a 60% (±2.5%) intensity (see Table 1 for equivalence in beat per minute and percentage of HRmax). THR = [(HRmax ? HRrest) ? % intensity + HRrest] The order of the sets was counterbalanced across participants and the two sets were separated by a resting period about 15 min. Each set began with a 10-min warm-up, which allowed participants, first and foremost, to individually adjust his or her stroke rate and stroke power to reach the required intensity (% HRmax). Then the five blocks were successively administrated and participants were asked to keep paddling during the transition between blocks (30 s). These “cognitive breaks,” at the end of each block, have been used to adjust the intensity of the effort by keeping the HR close to the THR. The exercise duration of each set, including the warm-up period, was about 24 min."	yes	0	athletes tested, sat on kayak ergometer		JW		0			EB		0	No Simon task

Fig. 1A). After 900 ms, a soft or loud tone was presented (S1). After an SOA of 100, 400, or 700 ms – randomized across trials – one of the letters “X” or “S” (S2) appeared at random above or below fixation. In the primary task (T1), participants had to respond to soft and loud tones by pressing the foot pedal with weak or strong force (120-990 vs. > 990 cN). Whether participants executed the pedal presses with the left or right foot was held constant over a given block of trials, but alternated between blocks.
 
 For the secondary task (T2), manual responses were required to the visual stimuli. The upper or lower response keys were to be touched to the letters “X” or “S”, in counterbalanced assignment. The response keys and the visual stimuli remained on the screen until both responses had been executed. If RT1 or RT2 were shorter than 150 ms or exceeded 2 s, the response was classified as an error. The tone-foot and the visual-manual task were first practiced as single tasks. That is, four to six blocks of practice were conducted in the tone-foot task – depending on the participant – and two practice blocks in the visual-manual task. Subsequently, in the main experiment, 14 blocks of 48 trials each were conducted with both tasks as dual task. Whether participants started with the left or right foot in the first block of T1 was counterbalanced. Between blocks, participants could make short self-terminated breaks. Any errors in T1 or T2 were signalled by a specific message on the screen, e.g. “too slow”, “too fast”, or “wrong response key”. If the manual response was executed before the foot response, it was also registered as error. Experiment 2: now a color version of the Simon paradigm was used as T2 in the PRP paradigm (cf. Fig. 1B for the basic design). For the non-spatial Simon task, one of the numerals “4” or “8” (font size 76 pt) was presented – at random in yellow or blue – at the location of the fixation mark on the black background. After conducting T1, participants were requested to press the yellow or blue key if an “8” or a “4” appeared, respectively, the mapping being balanced across participants."	yes	0	Too different from the original and focuses on alternative processes not related to Simon task		ME	apply ERP	0			LS_LW		0	No Simon task

This resulted in a total of 240 trials. Prior to each test block, a practice block of 10 trials was given. The order of the four conditions was randomly determined for each participant. In Experiment 1B, with unimanual responses, the number of trial blocks was increased to eight in order to accommodate responding with each hand at each combination of placement and mapping. Each participant completed the eight blocks of 60 trials in a randomized order, for a total of 480 trials. Before each trial block, written instructions shown on the screen indicated the hand placement that was to be used and whether to respond toward or away from the stimulus. The participant then performed the 10 practice trials with the mapping–placement combination. Once finished, there were again written instructions that stated the practice trials were over and to maintain the current position for the duration of that block, the remaining 60 stimuli.

 for Spoken Language Experiments-GDX. In Workshop on Games and Natural Language Processing (pp. 68-78)."	Demonstration of a Serious Game for Spoken Language Experiments — GDX	2020	Daniel Duran & Natalie Lewandowski		The classic experiment is a categorization test with acoustic stimuli, designed in a way to maximally resemble the game scenario (involving the category labels “human” and “alien”, just as in the game). All manipulated items belonged to the “alien” category, whereas the original recordings were used as the “human” samples. The nature of the manipulation was not communicated to the participants (neither in the perception test nor in the game). However, since the setting was an auditory categorization test, it was obvious to the participants that they were supposed to focus on cues in the sound of the stimuli. This is in stark contrast to the game scenario, where the target dimension of the signal was never explicitly nor circumstantially revealed to the participants. Similarly to the game, after a short training phase, subjects had to categorize the stimuli in three blocks, with one manipulation at a time (as in the three game levels).	"Two participants suffered from a mild case of cybersickness while playing the game (Frey et al., 2007; Rebenitsch and Owen, 2016). After a short break, however, they were able to continue with the experiment. Since the break occurred still within the training phase before any RTs were measured, the data did not have to be discarded but was included in the evaluation."	0	experimental set-up is a computer game (doesn't mention Simon effect)		JW	Not for inclusion.

Cotinine measurement
 Cotinine was measured in prenatal maternal and postnatal child urine: individuals with values between 0.05 and 0.99 ng/ml were classified as non-exposed, and those with 1.00–16.00 ng/ml as ETS-exposed (Supplement) (Benowitz et al., 2009, Florescu et al., 2009, Lee, 1991). Among participants who attempted a scan, 28 children were non-exposed and 20 (41.7%) exposed, mirroring US population estimates that 40% of children are ETS exposed (The Health Consequences of Smoking, 2014). Of the 41 children who successfully completed the structural scan, 24 were exposed, and of the 30 children who successfully completed the Simon task, 10 were exposed.
 2.3. Behavioral measures
 Maternal report on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a clinically validated questionnaire, was used to measure behavioral features of ADHD. Parent-report is the most commonly used clinical tool for assessing these behaviors (Bied et al., 2017). We examined three CBCL subscales: the empirically-based Attention Problems score measuring symptoms associated with ADHD, the DSM-oriented ADHD scale reflecting likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis, and the Externalizing behavior scale. Children completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-2nd edition (Wechsler, 1999).
 2.4. MRI acquisition
 Data were acquired on a 3T GE 750 scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Two structural T1 images were collected for each participant using a 3D-FSPGR sequence (flip angle = 11, TE = 2.588 ms, TR = 6.412 ms, 180 slices, 1 mm isotropic resolution). Three runs of Simon task data were acquired with an echo planar imaging sequence (flip angle = 77, TE = 25 ms, TR = 2000 ms, 44 slices, 3.0 mm isotropic resolution, 160 acquisition frames, 5 min and 32 s long). Structural data were processed using standard FreeSurfer v6.0 pipeline (recon-all) (Fischl et al., 2002, Fischl et al., 2004) and functional data using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)12, AFNI, and FSL (Supplement).
 2.5. Simon task
 During the Simon task (Craft and Simon, 1970), individuals press a button to indicate the direction an arrow is facing. Congruent (C) trials occur when a right-facing arrow appears on the right side of the screen, and incongruent (I) trials when a left-facing arrow appears on the right side of the screen or vice versa. The task thus requires engagement of control processes (inhibit the prepotent response to the arrow location and instead indicate the direction). Typically developing children respond faster to congruent than incongruent trials, activating bilateral IFG, ACC, and parietal regions during the resolution of conflict (Margolis et al., 2018). Prior studies suggest that reaction time (RT), indexing trial-wise difficulty resolving cognitive conflict, similarly associates with activation in the ACC, IFG, and thalamus (Weissman and Carp, 2013, Grinband et al., 2011). Thus, we were interested in trial-wise associations between brain activity and RT as well as associations between brain activation and event-related contrasts.
 First-level general linear models were generated in two ways (SPM12; Supplement). First, models include a regressor of interest for correct trials parametrically modulated by trial-wise RT and one for error trials with duration as RT. Second, models included 5 task regressors (duration as trial-wise RT) to examine second-level Incongruent-Congruent (I-C) contrast: post-congruent congruent, post-incongruent congruent, post-congruent incongruent, post-incongruent incongruent, and errors. All analyses included 24 head motion regressors (translation/rotation, their derivatives, and squares) and regressed out frames with framewise displacement >1 mm, as in pediatric task-based studies with similar TR (van Hulst et al., 2017)."	Of these 48, five children were unable to complete a structural scan and two children were excluded during quality control procedures (Supplement) for excessive head motion during the structural sequence, leaving 41 with useable structural data. Of 39 children who completed the Simon task, six were excluded for poor task accuracy (<50% correct on each run), two for excessive head motion (>20% of frames were outliers with >1 mm frame-wise displacement on each run (Siegel et al., 2014, Centanni et al., 2018), and 1 for a technical error, leaving 30 with useable task data.	0	sample consists of children, brain scans done		JW	don't think this should be included.

At the same time, the participants had to perform an S-R task. This task was designed as a series of stimulus and response spatial mapping pairs, and these were designated as the S-R spatial conditions. The stimulus presented in the S-R task was auditory or visual, designated as the modality. Participants were presented with three sessions, which included irrelevant, compatible, and incompatible spatial conditions, respectively. There were three conditions of no, free, or force visual-verbal load in each session. Each condition consisted of 20 visual and 20 auditory trials, 10 from the left and 10 from the right side in each modality. Accordingly, a participant was presented with three sessions × three conditions × 40 trials?=?360 trials. The order of the stimuli presented in each session was random. Initially, participants were randomly assigned to two groups. Group 
1 consisted of eight women and seven men and Group 2 consisted of seven women and eight men. At first, all participants were presented with 
Session 1. Next, the participants in Group 1 were presented with Session 
2 prior to Session 3; the participants in Group 2 were presented with Session 3 prior to Session 2. The experiment was run in three sessions with a 
week between sessions to reduce learning effects.
Session 1 was the irrelevant spatial condition. The participants were 
instructed to respond by pressing the upward arrow key when a stimulus 
was presented. Session 2 was the compatible spatial condition. The participants were asked to press the left arrow key for a visual or auditory 
stimulus from the left side and the right arrow key for a visual or auditory 
stimulus from the right side. Session 3 was the incompatible spatial condition. The participants were asked to press the right arrow key for a visual 
or auditory stimulus from the left side and the left arrow key for a visual 
or auditory stimulus from the right side.
Participants were presented with a visual or auditory stimulus and 
no other stimuli in the no visual-verbal load condition (No Load). In the 
free visual-verbal load condition (Free Load), a letter (A, B, C, or D) in Arial font appeared at 1-sec. intervals in the center of the monitor along with 
the visual or auditory stimulus. The participants were instructed to ignore 
the letter, but to respond to the visual or auditory stimulus. In the force visual-verbal load condition (Force Load), the letter display and visual and 
auditory stimuli were the same as in the free visual-verbal load condition, 
but the participants were instructed to count the number of times the letter “A” was presented in addition to responding to the visual or auditory 
stimulus. Then, at the end of each test block, the participants were asked 
to report their count result"	no	1	see notes		JW	I assume this is fine to include but it focusses very much on load	1			EB		0	No Simon task

F.	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235964	"Stimulus presentation software was developed by Eugene Terehov (https://www.linkedin.com/in/eterehov) and the program was run on an Apple iMac with a 24” screen. Stimuli were created in Adobe Illustrator (version CS4) and saved in a Portable Network Graphics format. The application and the stimuli employed are available at no cost for non-commercial research purposes by contacting the corresponding author.
 
 The task employed an equilateral triangle that pointed toward the left or right side of the computer screen. Participants were instructed to respond to a triangle that pointed to the left side of the screen by pressing the ‘q’ key with their left hand and to a right pointing triangle by pressing the ‘p’ key with their right hand. This created stimulus–response trials that were congruent (i.e., when a right pointing triangle was on the right side of the screen, which required a right hand response) and incongruent (i.e., when a left pointing stimulus was on the right side of the screen, which required a left hand response).
 
 The computer screen was centered at eye level at a distance of approximately 50 centimeters. Stimuli were presented in one of two locations on each side of a plus sign that served as a central fixation point. The screen presentation area for the task was 19.5cm x 19.5cm, with a white background. The fixation point was a plus sign comprised of black lines that were 14mm in length with a thickness of 0.75mm. The equilateral triangle used as a stimulus was dark gray in color (RGB settings: 133, 130,128) and 18mm2 in area. The triangle was employed instead of an arrow because it contained less salient semantic information related to direction.
 
 At the beginning of each version, participants were presented with 20 practice trials used to familiarize them with the response keys, as well as to obtain simple RT for left and right responses. On these trials, a 15 mm diameter black circle was shown for 400milliseconds (ms) to the right or left of center at a visual angle of 6° for 20 trials. If the circle appeared on the left, they were instructed to press the q key; if on the right they were to press the p key. All trials began with the appearance of the plus sign for 400ms, followed by a variable interval (350–750ms) before the stimulus appeared for 400ms. The next trial began 500ms after the participant’s response. The plus sign remained on the screen between trials and disappeared only when a pop-up screen appeared after each set of 20 trials to indicate that the participant could take a break. Trails were resumed once the participant pressed the space bar.
 
 Following the practice trials, participants were told they would see a triangle appear on the right or left part of the screen and use the keys to indicate if the triangle pointed to the right or left side of the computer screen. In the first version (No Box), the triangle appeared to the right or left of the fixation point in one of the two horizontal positions on each side. The visual angle of the outer position was 8° and the inner position 5°. The eighty experimental trials were presented in a pseudorandom order that varied by position relative to the plus sign (inner vs outer), arrow direction (pointing left vs right) and side of presentation (left or right).
 
 In the second version (Box), the identical procedures were used, but a square box frame surrounded the visual field for the inner and outer positions for triangle appearance in each visual hemi field. Thus, the stimulus was aligned with the left or right side of the box, separated from the edge by 3mm. The second version also included the 20 practice trials. All participants were tested in both versions, with order of presentation counterbalanced within sex. The congruent and incongruent stimuli for both versions of the Simon tasks are depicted in Fig 1."	yes	1		yes	ME		1			LS_LW		1

A self-monitoring test [18] and the short version of the Big Five
Personality Questionnaire – the BFI-10 [19] – were administered. The self-monitoring scale is a German adaptation of earlier work of Snyder (1974) and assesses the need for social approval. It provides a total score and additional scores on the four
subscales Acting, Extraversion, Other-Directedness and Sensitivity for Social Cues and Expressive Behavior. The BFI-10 encompasses a ten-item questionnaire and provides scores on the
well-known standard personality features extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. Both
tests were filled in on screen by the participants.
2.2. Cognitive tests
The cognitive tests within this study were two tests for attention
(inhibition): a Simon and a Stroop Test. The first is also called
a test for mental flexibility [7], which is a nonverbal test for
inhibition, a cognitive component much discussed for its influence on phonological processing skills (e.g. [2, 1]). The Simon
Test is based on spatial competition arising from the stimuli and
requires clicking on the target appearing either on the congruent or opposite (= incongruent) side of the screen. Clicking on
the incongruent targets is usually tied to a higher error rate and
longer reaction times, since it requires overcoming (i.e. inhibiting) the existing spatial interference. The second was a Stroop
Test [6, 20], a verbal test for attention, usually based on naming congruent or incongruent ink colors of printed color names.
Here as well, the correct answer follows the inhibition of the
habitual response, i.e., the reading of the color names, which is
the more automatic task. Further typical inhibitory tests are the
Antisaccade Test [21, 22] and the Stop-Signal-Test [23].
2.3. Gamified Discrimination Experiment Engine – GDX
In order to test implicit attention to fine phonetic detail, we employ the Gamified Discrimination Experiment Engine (GDX)
framework which was used as one of the test scenarios in the
GECO2 database1 [24, 16]. The subjects are not instructed to
pay attention to the phonetics explicitly – neither within the
game nor by the experimenters prior to the test session. Rather,
responding to differences in phonetic features is crucial for success within the first-person shooter game scenario. Participants
in the game move through an alien invasion scenario and are
supposed to tell the difference between humans and aliens in
order to rescue the former and freeze (immobilize) the latter.
The aliens, however, are disguised as humans, so targets can
only be told apart by paying attention to the sounds they make.
The game-like scenario yields more naturalistic data as it
imposes a less artificial laboratory setting upon the subjects in
comparison to traditional perception tests. The latter require
conscious decisions focusing all attention explicitly on the task.
With respect to perception of phonetic detail in every day situations, that is a highly unnatural situation making any generalizations on human speech perception from these tests questionable.
We address this problem by employing a game paradigm in
which access fluidity (the speed and/or automaticity of connecting words to their meaning) and attention control (the ability
to focus and refocus attention on different semantic levels, i.e.
local vs. global meaning relations or sound vs. meaning) [25]
are a natural part of the game, and acoustic/auditory targets can
easily be tied into the scenario. The utility of GDX has been val1The version of the game employed in this study was called ?X 732.
idated against a classical perception experiment [26, 27]. This
framework provides a good balance between spontaneous data
and full experimental control, and allows for a better distinction of participants’ individual differences in a natural scenario
resembling everyday speech perception.
Although the game implements a forced-choice categorization test, the evaluation of its results is more complex in comparison to classic computer-based test frameworks such as DMDX
[28] or Praat’s “MFC” [29], for example. There are multiple
ways to evaluate responses during experimental trials because
the player not only has to respond with the left of right mouse
button, but has to aim at a moving target at the same time. If the
player does not hit the target with the first click she/he has to
click again until the target is hit2
. The game produces a log of
all relevant events, such as mouse clicks, the position and orientation of the target agents (which trigger experimental trials),
and the player in world space and on screen. It also captures
data relevant for timing of each event (like frame counts as well
as absolute time using low level system time measurements, or
the current frame rate at which the game is rendered). For this
study, we extracted the following data from the game logs:
• The onset of each trial: the time, the acoustic stimulus
and its category.
• The first click after trial onset by the player: the time and
the response category (mouse button).
• The hit (i e. final click within a trial): the time and the
response category (mouse button).
Based on these data, we computed two measures: (1) the reaction time, i.e. the time difference between trial onset and hit,
and (2) the relative reaction time, i.e. the time difference between the offset of the audio stimulus and the hit (taking into
account the variable length of our stimuli). In total 7264 trials
were evaluated. Out of these, only 202 did not hit the target with
the first click (mean click number per trial = 1.032) and only in
one case did the subject respond with a different mouse button
on the first click in comparison to the final hit. Thus taking the
hit events as the subjects response seems appropriate.
Twenty-two adult native speakers of German participated
in the experiments (11 female). No participant reported any
known hearing impairments. All test subjects gave their written
informed consent to participate in the study. The participants’
test data are part of the second German Conversations database
(GECO2) [15]. The computer game and the psychological and
cognitive tests took place in a sound-attenuated psycholinguistics laboratory, with additional head-mounted AKG headphones
where sound was involved (i.e. during the computer game).
2.4. Speech material
Speech stimuli for GDX were created from utterances spoken
by an adult female native speaker of Standard High German.
Various utterances, ranging from single words to entire short
sentences were recorded in a sound attenuated booth. Their
content was related only in part to the contents of the game,
and most stimuli were devoid of any meaningful relation to the
game storyline or the game level appearance. This was motivated by the desire to create a plausible game environment, on
the one hand, and the expectation that a number of semantically
unrelated stimuli may imply to the players that the meaning is not the essential cue, on the other hand. Four phonetic features
have been manipulated using Praat [29]: increased range of
the fundamental frequency (f0), heightened second vowel formant (F2), increased voice onset time of plosives (VOT) and removed lower frequencies in the spectrum of fricative sounds using a band-pass filter. The manipulated stimuli were associated
within the game with one category (A) and the original utterances with the alternative category (B). The four different phonetic cue categories correspond to four experiment levels of the
game, each of which implements an A–B categorization task.
This means that the subjects always had to figure out only one
specific difference in pronunciation per game level and never
encountered more of them mixed together.
2.5. Procedure
Participants were seated for the perception test (the game) in
a quiet, window-less psycholinguistics laboratory in front of a
computer screen. A standard office keyboard and a mouse were
used as input devices. Participants were wearing headphones.
The game was run on a Windows platform. The display resolution of the game used for this study was 1680×1050 pixels.
At the beginning of the session, participants were instructed to
adjust the sound volume to a comfortable level, such that they
can “hear well”. It was not pointed out to the participants that
they had to rely on the speech stimuli in order to distinguish
the two target categories. The time limit for each experiment
level was set to 12 minutes. A session with the game thus lasted
for approximately one hour in total (including a training level
where participants were familiarized with the game controls,
not the stimuli). The trials within each experiment level have
been randomized without repetitions of stimuli for each participant. During the entire session, the player was alone in the room
and the experimenter waited in the room next door"	no	1			JW	Screened by Mahmoud Elsherif and Julia Wolska, this is a book chapter	0	SDs not reported		BB_JPR		0	No Simon task
